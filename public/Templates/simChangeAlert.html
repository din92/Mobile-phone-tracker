<h1>Get alert on sim change</h1>
<p>If the SIM card from your lost device is changed, there is a high risk of personal information theft. 
    Find My Mobile notifies the owner when the deviceâ€™s SIM card has been changed. Also, a text message that your SIM card has been changed is sent to the number set for the Lock my device feature.
*Certain features may not be supported, depending on the model and region.</p>
